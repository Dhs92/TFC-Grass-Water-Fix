This resource pack adds foliage color codes for foliage and grass blocks for [TFC](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrafirmacraft) to make it compatible with [Bluemap](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/).

TFC 1.21.1 reworked the soil system and added over 100 new plants. To keep the file size down, I am going to be shipping 1.20.1 and 1.21.1 support separately.

1.21.1 releases will be tagged as v5 and 1.20.1 as v4.

# Installation
Copy the resource pack to `/config/bluemap/packs` and run `/bluemap reload` in game. If your map has already been generated you will need to run `/bluemap purge <worldname>` to update existing chunks.
